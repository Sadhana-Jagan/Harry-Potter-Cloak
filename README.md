# Harry-Potter-Cloak

## Description

This Python script creates an "invisible cloak" effect using computer vision techniques. By detecting a specific color (blue in this implementation), the script replaces that color region with a pre-captured background, creating an illusion of invisibility.

## Features
1. Detects and isolates a specific color in a video feed using HSV color space.
2. Replaces the detected regions with a previously captured background.
3. Includes preprocessing steps to clean up noise and ensure smooth transitions.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. OpenCV library
3. NumPy library
